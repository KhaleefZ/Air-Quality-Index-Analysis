# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – India

## 📝 Project Description

A comprehensive web application designed to inform users about historical air pollution levels across India from 2020 to 2023. The platform includes interactive visualizations, state-wise trends, and detailed insights on AQI (Air Quality Index), helping individuals, organizations, and researchers make informed decisions and promote environmental awareness.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 📚 **AQI Overview** – Understand what AQI is, how it is calculated, and why it matters.
- 🌍 **Interactive Maps** – Visualize AQI data across India using dynamic Plotly maps.
- 📊 **State-wise Trends** – Analyze date-wise, month-wise, and year-wise AQI for individual states.
- 🧠 **Awareness & Education** – Learn about pollutants, air quality standards, and health impacts.

## 🌐 Pages Overview

### 📄 Main Page
- Introduces AQI, its significance, pollutants involved, and their effects on health and the environment.
- Presents standard AQI classification and government-defined safe levels.

### 🗺️ Map Page
- Interactive Plotly map showcasing AQI distribution across Indian cities.
- Lists **Top 10 cities** with the highest AQI levels for each pollutant.

### 🏙️ State Page
- Drill down into **state-specific trends**.
- View AQI statistics over different timeframes: **daily**, **monthly**, and **yearly**.
- Identify pollution patterns and spikes over time.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 🤖 Integrate **machine learning models** to predict pollutant behavior and classify severity.
- 🔮 Add **AI-powered forecasting** to predict AQI for upcoming dates.
- 🌐 Support **real-time sensor data** to provide live AQI updates.

## 👥 Target Audience

- **Individuals** monitoring air quality for health and lifestyle.
- **Environmental bodies** for research and policymaking.
- **NGOs and advocacy groups** focused on climate and health awareness.
- **Students and researchers** analyzing pollution trends and impacts.

## ✅ Benefits
